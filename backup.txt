# Здесь я на всякий случай сохранил тексты для секции "About Me"

My Experience
With over 5 years of experience in portrait, event, and landscape photography, I have had the pleasure of working with a diverse range of clients, from individuals to brands.

My Approach
I believe that the best photographs are those that capture real, raw emotions. I focus on natural light and creating an atmosphere where the subject feels at ease.

Equipment
I work with a professional Sony Alpha camera and prefer to use lenses that are ideal for portrait photography to capture the smallest details.
